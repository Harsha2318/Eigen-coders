Build a real-time Healthcare RAG for dynamic data injection.


Real-Time RAG System for Healthcare

An AI-powered medical assistant that provides **real-time, evidence-based** clinical insights using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).**

---

Problem Statement
Medical professionals need **real-time, reliable, and up-to-date** medical insights for **clinical decision-making.** Traditional AI models rely on static knowledge, leading to **outdated or inaccurate** recommendations.

Solution
The **Real-Time RAG System for Healthcare** provides:
- **Continuous ingestion and indexing** of medical research from **PubMed** and **WHO APIs.**
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to fetch relevant, evidence-based insights.
- **Context-aware responses** with **source citations.**
- **Clinical decision support** with **transparent AI outputs.**

---

 Features
 
**Real-Time Data Ingestion** – Fetches and updates medical literature dynamically.  
**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** – Ensures responses are based on the latest research.  
**Agent-Based Reasoning** – Uses **LangGraph** for structured multi-step decision-making.  
**Medical-Specific Language Model** – Uses **LLaMA** for accurate medical text generation.  
**Explainable AI** – Provides **direct citations** for every response.  
**Fast and Scalable** – Uses **Pathway** for real-time processing and indexing.

##  Tech Stack
| **Component**             | **Technology Used**        |
|---------------------------|--------------------------  |              |
| Medical Data Sources      | **PubMed API, WHO API**    |
| Orchestration & Reasoning | **LangGraph**              |
|  AI Model for Text Gen.   | **LLaMA**                  |
|  Backend API              | **FastAPI / Flask**        |
|  Frontend UI              | **React.js + Tailwind CSS**|

---

##  How It Works
1️⃣ **Data Ingestion** – Fetches and structures medical data from **PubMed** and **WHO**.  
2️⃣ **Indexing and Retrieval** – Stores and retrieves relevant information efficiently.  
3️⃣ **Contextual Processing** – Uses **LangGraph** to analyze and structure responses.  
4️⃣ **Response Generation** – **LLaMA** generates answers with **citations** for trust and transparency.

##  Installation
### 🔹 Prerequisites
- Python **3.9+**


### 🔹 Backend Setup
```sh
git clone https://github.com/harsha2318/Eigen-coders
cd medical-rag
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload  # If using FastAPI
```

### 🔹 Frontend Setup
```sh
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```
