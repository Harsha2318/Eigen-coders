Build a real-time Healthcare RAG for dynamic data injection.


Real-Time RAG System for Healthcare

An AI-powered medical assistant that provides **real-time, evidence-based** clinical insights using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).**

---

Problem Statement
Medical professionals need **real-time, reliable, and up-to-date** medical insights for **clinical decision-making.** Traditional AI models rely on static knowledge, leading to **outdated or inaccurate** recommendations.

Solution
The **Real-Time RAG System for Healthcare** provides:
- **Continuous ingestion and indexing** of medical research from **PubMed** and **WHO APIs.**
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to fetch relevant, evidence-based insights.
- **Context-aware responses** with **source citations.**
- **Clinical decision support** with **transparent AI outputs.**

 Features
 
**Real-Time Data Ingestion** ‚Äì Fetches and updates medical literature dynamically.  
**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** ‚Äì Ensures responses are based on the latest research.  
**Agent-Based Reasoning** ‚Äì Uses **LangGraph** for structured multi-step decision-making.  
**Medical-Specific Language Model** ‚Äì Uses **LLaMA** for accurate medical text generation.  
**Explainable AI** ‚Äì Provides **direct citations** for every response.  
**Fast and Scalable** ‚Äì Uses **Pathway** for real-time processing and indexing.
